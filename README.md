# Swedish Embassy

Swedish Embassy is a camp arranged by a number of Swedish hackers that
want to get together and build awesome stuff and drink a lot.

## Members of the Embassy

We're a bunch of people, some organize themselves in groups.

### Hackverket

Hackverket are the founding fathers of the Swedish Embassy and the
point-of-contact for the embassy.

We like surstr√∂mming and warm lager beer - preferably Berliner
Pilsener.
